 Pre-Requisites: What You Need To Know
#######################################

This book will guide you from being a novice with TurboGears to a
fully informed developer capable of deploying projects for your
customers (internal or external) quickly.

To do that, this book must skip over several topics, or else become longer than `War and Peace <http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600>`_. Instead, consult the below list (and the associated links) for anything you are not already comfortably familiar with.

* `Python 2.x <http://www.python.org/>`_ (TurboGears does not currently run on Python 3.x)
* `HTML <http://w3schools.com/html/default.asp>`_
* `CSS <http://w3schools.com/css/default.asp>`_

You simply *must* have the above skills already, or you will find doing anything with TurboGears very difficult. The following two skills will be extremely helpful, but are not 100% required (only about 95%).

* `XML <http://w3schools.com/xml/default.asp>`_
* `JavaScript <http://w3schools.com/js/default.asp>`_

The following skills are not required, and this book will teach you the parts you need to know as you progress through it. However, if you already have experience with the pieces listed below, it will help you out.

* `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_
* `ToscaWidgets <http://www.toscawidgets.org/>`_
* `Sprox <http://www.sprox.org/>`_
* `jQuery <http://www.jquery.org/>`_
