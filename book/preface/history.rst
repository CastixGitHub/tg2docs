 The History of the TurboGears Project
***************************************

In September 2005, Kevin Dangoor released a brand new framework, one that would allow developers to use the Model-View-Controller model with code that is as natural as writing a function. Simple, elegent, and it raised excitement levels in the Python web development community: Within the first 3 months, the screencast that announced TurboGears had received over 30,000 downloads.

At the time, TurboGears used CherryPy to act as the dispatching component, and SQLObject to act as the database management and mapping tool.

In November, 2006, the book `Rapid Web Applications with TurboGears: Using Python to Create AJAX Powered Sites <http://www.amazon.com/Rapid-Web-Applications-TurboGears-Ajax-Powered/dp/0132433885>`_ was published. Even though 1.0 was not yet released, the book was the definitive answer for that version of the framework and helped developers learn to use the TurboGears 1.x framework from the ground up.

Work continued apace until January 3, 2007, when the community was able to release 1.0. With that release, Kevin stepped down as the leader of the project, turning it over to Alberto Valverde.

In June, 2007, the community began working to build TurboGears on top of Pylons and SQLAlchemy, replacing CherryPy and SQLObject (respectively). During the initial experiments, it was hoped that Pylons and TurboGears would merge, but this was unable to happen. Pylons is focused on providing a low level framework, while TurboGears is focused on providing a full stack for the developer. The two goals are fundamentally different, which prevented any merger from taking place.

Alberto Valverde led TurboGears until real life commitments pulled him away. In March, 2008, the organizational change was made that put Florent Aide in charge of TuboGears 1.x, and Mark Ramm in charge of TurboGears 2.x, allowing Alberto Valverde to step down as the leader.

On July 1, 2008, the first public beta of the TurboGears 2.x line was made available. This would not solidify into TurboGears 2.0 until May, 2009.

The TurboGears 2.1 release cycle took longer than normal, with activity slowing down tremendously through 2010. The leadership of the project had found itself swamped with real life concerns, resulting in significant delars. The release of 2.1 was finally launched in November, 2010.

In October, 2010, discussions began with the Pylons and Repoze.BFG communities to merge. TurboGears, Pylons, and Repoze.BFG agreed to merge into one framework. Work is under way to produce TurboGears 3, named Orion, using the merged framework (Pyramid) as a base. No publicly available version of Orion has occurred yet.

In January, 2011, Michael Pedersen stepped up to begin working on the code and infrastructure. The community migrated much of the infrastructure to `SourceForge <http://www.sourceforge.net/p/turbogears2/>`_, and finally released 2.1.1 in June, 2011. With the numerous beneficial changes to the process and infrastructure, the community is expecting to begin releasing new versions of the project on a monthly basis.

This book will become a part of the official codebase with the 2.2 release. Between now and then, the book will be written to help bring developers up to speed.

Development is now focused on the 2.x line, with the drive to bring the code as close to perfection as possible. The goals include completing testing coverage, high performance, and quality documentation.

The 1.x line is far from abandoned, though. TurboGears 1.x has many projects out there, and their developers and users are not being abandoned.
