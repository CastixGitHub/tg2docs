TurboGears Documentation:
=============================

TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take advantage of
new components, and to provide a fully customizable :term:`WSGI` (Web Server
Gateway Interface) stack.  From the beginning TurboGears was designed to be a
Full Stack framework built from best-of-breed components. New components have
been released which improved on the ones in the original TGstack, and the Python
web world has been increasingly designed around WSGI.

This has enabled a whole new world of reuse, and TG2 is designed to
take advantage of this fact in order to make a framework which provides
easy to use,  productive defaults, while still providing flexibility where
it's useful.

TG2 represents a change from some of the components in TurboGears 1, but
we've now invested in a set of components that we think will continue to be at
the center of python web development for years to come.

Getting Started with TurboGears
==================================

Get TurboGears 2 installed, learn how to create a new TurboGears project in a
single command, and of course explore the obligatory "Hello World" example,
with a few fun treats thrown in, and move on to a more complete example of
creating a very simple wiki.
