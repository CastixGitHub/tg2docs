TurboGears Documentation
========================

TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take advantage of
new components, and to provide a fully customizable :term:`WSGI` (Web Server
Gateway Interface) stack.   From the beginning TurboGears was designed to be a
Full Stack framework built from best-of-breed components. New components have
been released which improved on the ones in the original TGstack, and the Python
web world has been increasingly designed around WSGI.

This has enabled a whole new world of reuse, and TG2 is designed to
take advantage of this fact in order to make a framework which provides
easy to use,  productive defaults, while still providing flexibility where
it's useful.

TG2 represents a change from some of the components in TurboGears 1, but
we've now invested in a set of components that we think will continue to be at
the center of python web development for years to come.

Documentation is broken into several components. Feel free to jump directly
to the place you need to be, or read the information below sequentially.


:ref:`Getting Started <getting-started>`
----------------------------------------
    Get TurboGears installed and serving up the main page for your new
    project

:ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>`
----------------------------

    For the new TurboGears user, this is the place to start.  These tutorials 
    are intended to get you started working quickly and give you a feel for 
    how TurboGears applications work.

:ref:`Working with TurboGears <recipes-and-faq>`
------------------------------------------------
    How to accomplish given tasks using TurboGears, from authentication, to 
    caching, to user-session management.  This collection of documents should 
    normally be explored after you've followed through a tutorial or two.

:ref:`Getting To Know TurboGears <getting-to-know>`
---------------------------------------------------
    Learn what's new in the latest TurboGears. Explore the architecture. Learn
    what components come with the default install of TurboGears, what
    components are installed via the default quickstart, and how all of them
    tie together to serve your site.

:ref:`Extensions and Tools <extensions-and-tools>`
--------------------------------------------------
    Discover new extensions and tools to enhance your installation of
    TurboGears.

:ref:`Testimonials <testimonials>`
----------------------------------
    A selection of papers and comments showing how TurboGears helped other
    developers solve the problems they had.

.. todo:: Difficulty: Medium. make docs more linky.   provide link to pylons, and why tg2 is now based on it.   eventually, I'd really like to see links to pylonsbook for specific "more information", and how turbogears is different/expands upon it
