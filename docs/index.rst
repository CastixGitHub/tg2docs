TurboGears Documentation
========================

.. todo:: make docs more linky.   provide link to pylons, and why tg2 is now based on it.   eventually, I'd really like to see links to pylonsbook for specific "more information", and how turbogears is different/expands upon it

TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take advantage of
new components, and to provide a fully customizable :term:`WSGI` (Web Server
Gateway Interface) stack.   TurboGears 2 is now built on Pylons - and you can find out more
about the history and why this change was made how:ref:`whatsnew`.  
From the beginning TurboGears was designed to be a
Full Stack framework built from best-of-breed components. New components have
been released which improved on the ones in the original TGstack, and the Python
web world has been increasingly designed around WSGI.

This has enabled a whole new world of reuse, and TG2 is designed to
take advantage of this fact in order to make a framework which provides
easy to use,  productive defaults, while still providing flexibility where
it's useful.

TG2 represents a change from some of the components in TurboGears 1, but
we've now invested in a set of components that we think will continue to be at
the center of python web development for years to come.

Documentation is broken into several components. Feel free to jump directly
to the place you need to be, or read the information below sequentially.


:ref:`getting-started`
-------------------------------
    Get TurboGears installed and serving up the main page for your new
    project

:ref:`tutorials`
-------------------------------
    The obligatory "Hello World" example, coupled with several other
    examples (and not all of them are purely TurboGears). These should help
    answer some of the basic "How do I ... ?" questions.

:ref:`whatsnew`
-------------------------------
    Learn about the new features of TurboGears 2.

:ref:`getting-to-know`
-------------------------------
    Exploring the architecture of TurboGears. Learn what components come
    with the default install of TurboGears, what components are installed
    via the default quickstart, and how all of them tie together to serve
    your site.

:ref:`recipes-and-faq`
-------------------------------
    Simple code samples to answer commonly asked questions about
    development and deployment of TurboGears

:ref:`extensions-and-tools`
-------------------------------
    Discover new extensions and tools to enhance your installation of
    TurboGears.

:ref:`testimonials`
-------------------------------
    A selection of papers and comments showing how TurboGears helped other
    developers solve the problems they had.

:ref:`general-project-info`
-------------------------------
    Pieces of information about the TurboGears project, instead of about
    the code.

:ref:`todolist`
-------------------------------
    The list of todo items for the documentation.
