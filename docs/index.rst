TurboGears Documentation:
=============================

TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take advantage of
new components, and to provide a fully customizable :term:`WSGI` (Web Server
Gateway Interface) stack.  From the beginning TurboGears was designed to be a
Full Stack framework built from best-of-breed components. New components have
been released which improved on the ones in the original TGstack, and the Python
web world has been increasingly designed around WSGI.

This has enabled a whole new world of reuse, and TG2 is designed to
take advantage of this fact in order to make a framework which provides
easy to use,  productive defaults, while still providing flexibility where
it's useful.

TG2 represents a change from some of the components in TurboGears 1, but
we've now invested in a set of components that we think will continue to be at
the center of python web development for years to come.

Documentation is broken into several components. Feel free to jump directly
to the place you need to be, or read the information below sequentially.

Up and Running
    Get TurboGears installed and serving up the main page for your new
    project

Tutorials
    The obligatory "Hello World" example, coupled with several other
    examples (and not all of them are purely TurboGears). These should help
    answer some of the basic "How do I ... ?" questions.

Getting to Know TurboGears
    Exploring the architecture of TurboGears. Learn what components come
    with the default install of TurboGears, what components are installed
    via the default quickstart, and how all of them tie together to serve
    your site.

Recipes and FAQ
    Simple code samples to answer commonly asked questions about
    development and deployment of TurboGears

Testimonials, White Papers, and Case Studies
    A selection of papers and comments showing how TurboGears helped other
    developers solve the problems they had.
