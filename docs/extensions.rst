Extensions and Tools
==========================

TG2 has some extensions which offer built-in functionality you can add
to your application.  This is somewhat different from installing a
WSGI application in your stack because the extensions are intended to
be more tightly integrated with the components that make up a
TurboGears application.

This is a list of core TurboGears extensions and tutorials that involve optional packages.
