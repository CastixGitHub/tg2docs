Sometimes, you don't need a tutorial. Sometimes, you just need to see
some sample code, or get a specific answer to a specific question, and
tutorials are just too much for you. If that's you, might we suggest
checking out our :ref:`Recipes and FAQ <recipes-and-faq>`?

Old Tutorials
============================

Those tutorials are related to parts of the framework that
got deprecated in the past and are here only for reference
or for projects that still rely on previous versions of
TurboGears.
