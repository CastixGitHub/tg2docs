Rapid Prototyping: A Wiki using the TurboGears Admin
==========================================================

TurboGears2 Wikier application is inspired by the :ref:`TurboGears2 20 Minutes Wiki <wiki20>` Tutorial.

While the 20 Minutes Wiki is a great way to learn writing custom TurboGears2 applications
the Wikier tutorial tries to provide more focus on rapid prototyping with the ambitious target of
making it possible to create a full featured Wiki in minimum possible time.

It will showcase some basic concepts of the TurboGears2 Web Framework and how to best use rapid prototyping tools
available in the standard extension modules.
