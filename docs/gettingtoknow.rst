About the TurboGears Project
=============================

This document describes the internal workings of TurboGears, how 
the system is constructed, how the pieces fit together, and how 
to navigate the source-code for the project.  Normally you will 
want to read these pages in order to extend, debug, or change the 
behaviour of TurboGears, or to start contributing to the project.

You will want to have read:

 * :ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>` which describes how to get started with TurboGears
 * :ref:`recipes-and-faq` which describes how to accomplish particular tasks with TurboGears

before diving into this material.
