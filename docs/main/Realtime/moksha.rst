Moksha
======

The `Moksha Project`_ is an Open Source (`AGPL`_) Python web framework
that aims to simplify the creation of highly-interactive realtime web
applications.

Moksha provides a plugin system for easily integrating existing apps,
widgets, technologies, and APIs. It offers a realtime messaging layer
for the web, which lets you build rich dashboards of live interactive
widgets, while also making it easy to produce and react to messages

Moksha is currently in the **alpha** stages, and is still under heavy
development. If you are interested in Moksha you should consider
