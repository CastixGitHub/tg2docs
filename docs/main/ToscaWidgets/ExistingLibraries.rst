Existing ToscaWidgets Packages
==============================

ToscaWidgets has been around for a few years and has grown a significant
set of widget libraries.  TW has grown from it's simple roots defining
Form widgets to include a full suite of ajax enabled capabilities.
Recent versions of TW even support on-widget controllers which makes
it easy to encapsulate both server and client side code in the same
object.  In addition to form functionality nearly every major JavaScript 
library is wrapped in someway by ToscaWidgets.



Form Libraries
--------------------

tw.forms
++++++++++++++++++++++
The form library that started it all.  This library allows you to create
forms and fields with objects instead of raw html.  Coupled with FormEncode
validation, this library provides a powerful tool for the creation of 
validated forms for your application.
